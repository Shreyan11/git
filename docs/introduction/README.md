# Introduction
This project aims towards giving a clear picture of how git actually works,inspired by Mary Rose  Cook's Git from the inside out
For those of you unfamiliar with git,you need to first learn about version control.Version Control is how you make sure that if you and someone else (or a group of people) are working on something (like a document) you can trace who made what changes and when. So you don't accidentally overwrite something and you can go back to the last person who made changes and what they did. If you've ever used google docs on a group project you've done some sort of real time version control.
  
Git is a type of version control software that's especially helpful for maintaining version control not just for documents but for all sorts of files you'd need when developing software or a computer program.

This version of git is written in Python (3.5+) and uses only standard library modules. Itâ€™s just over 500 lines of code, including blank lines and comments. At a minimum I needed the init, add, commit, and push commands, but pygit also implements status, diff, cat-file, ls-files, and hash-object.
